Read in data from [Mike Byerly. 2016. Alaska commercial salmon catches by management region (1886- 1997). urn:node:GOA. df35b.304.2.](https://knb.ecoinformatics.org/#view/df35b.304.2)

```{r}
catch_df <- read.csv(url("https://knb.ecoinformatics.org/knb/d1/mn/v2/object/df35b.302.1", method = "libcurl"),
                    stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
head(catch_df)
```
```{r}
catch_df <- catch_df %>% 
  select(-All, -notesRegCode)

head(catch_df)
```
Transposed data using "gather" and renamed the column to reflect units
```{r}
catch_df <- catch_df %>% 
  gather(key ="species", value = "catch", -Region, -Year) %>% 
  rename(catch_thousands = catch)
  
head(catch_df)
```

```{r}
catch_integers <- as.integer(catch_df$catch_thousands)

i <- which(is.na(catch_integers) == T)

catch_df$catch_thousands[i]
```
1) turn "I" into 1 in the catch_thousands column
2) coerce catch_thousand into integer type
3) convert catch_thousands to catch

```{r}
catch_df <- catch_df %>% 
  mutate(catch_thousands = ifelse(catch_thousands == "I", 1, catch_thousands)) %>% 
  mutate(catch_thousands =as.integer(catch_thousands)) %>% 
  rename (catch_thousands=catch_thousands)

tail(catch_df)
```
